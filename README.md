# Overview

This project contains Golang binding for the Microsoft Cognitive Service Speech SDK.

# Getting Started

This project requires Go 3.13

## Linux

### Compiling

First, you new need to set the environment variables for Go to find the SDK:


```bash
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/SDKs/include/c_api"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/SDKs/library -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core"

```

After that we are ready to compile the package

### Running

To run applications consuming this project, we need to add the library to the path (if it is not there already)

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/SDKs/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### Running Tests

In addition to the environment variables needed to run applications, running tests requires setting the following variables:

```bash
export TEST_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY="your_subscription_key"
export TEST_SUBSCRIPTION_REGION="your_region"
```
